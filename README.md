```

**Note:** There is a known issue for integrating swift written plugin into Flutter project created with Objective-C template.
See issue [Flutter#16049](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/16049) for help on integration.


### Permission

Android and iOS require to declare the location permission in a configuration file.

#### For iOS

There are two kinds of location permission available in iOS: "when in use" and "always".

If you don't know what permission to choose for your usage, see:
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/choosing_the_authorization_level_for_location_services

You need to declare the description for the desired permission in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<dict>
  <!-- for iOS 11 + -->
  <key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
  <string>Reason why app needs location</string>
  <key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
  <string>Reason why app needs location</string>

  <!-- additionally for iOS 9/10, if you need always permission -->
  <key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
  <string>Reason why app needs location</string>
  ...
</dict>
```
